# Program

Program for linear front of ellipse-shaped cells that twist while growing

## Important parameters

There are a number of parameters in this simulation. The most important are:

twist - twist rate (degrees / cell cycle)
layerdepth - growth layer depth
alpha0 - aspect ratio at birth
b - damping coefficient# chirality
